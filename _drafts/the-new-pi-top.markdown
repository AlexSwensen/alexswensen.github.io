# TLDR:

If you are looking for a Raspberry Pi laptop for hacking on your personal projects, [the new pi-top 2](https://pi-top.com/) is a great option for the price, but there are some manufacturing, ergonomic, and customer service issues that should be looked into. I'd give it a solid `B-`. Room for improvement.
# Background

If you have never heard of the Pi-Top, You have been missing out.
The [Original Pi-Top](https://pi-top.com/products/pi-top-original) was a crowd funded project to turn a Raspberry Pi into a portable laptop computer, with an emphasis on educating young new software engineers. Complete with screen, mouse, and keyboard.

Now spend a bit of time on google, and you will see that the first version was pretty cool, but it certainly had its share of issues. From the awkward placement of the keyboard and trackpad, to the small hole on the side where you hoped you could fit a USb dongle.

[The pi-topCEED](https://pi-top.com/products/ceed), the desktop version, has several improvements over the original pitop. The modular rail became magnetic, rather than an area where you had to screw in parts.

Now pi-top is back with [version 2](https://pi-top.com/products/pi-top) of their laptop. When I saw their new design, I decided it was good enough that i would check it out for myself. It arrived just a few weeks ago. Now after using it for a bit, I would like to give my thoughts so far.

# Customer Service

Initially when I pre-ordered my pi-top there was no date listed for when I could expect it to arrive. After a while of waiting i attempted to contact pi-top twice, about a month apart. The second time i got a response that I could expect to see it in the next two weeks. About a week later it arrived at my door.
It would have been nice to get a faster response. Even ebay sellers respond within a week at the outside.

# Unboxing & Assembly.

pi-top does an awesome job with their unboxing experience. I won't spoil it for you, but suffice it to say for young learners it can be an almost magical experience. You can tell that they put a lot of pride into their product. There were, however, a few _interesting_ aspects of that experience that I feel should be mentioned.

There were really only three less-than-ideal things that I encountered. The first was the protector on the screen has a small tab at the edge. Due to how the pitop's bezzle overlays part of the screen cover, the small tab did not have enough pull to take the plastic protector off on its own, and instead came undone from the protector. I had to do some surgery to get it off. I would suggest users be very careful when removing it as there is no hint in the instructions that this is the case.
