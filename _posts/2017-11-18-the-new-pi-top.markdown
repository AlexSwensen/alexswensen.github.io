# TLDR:

If you are looking for a Raspberry Pi laptop for hacking on your personal projects, the pi-top 2 is a great option for the price, but there are some manufacturing, ergonomic, and customer service issues that should be looked into. I'd give it a solid `B-`. Room for improvement.
# Background

If you have never heard of the Pi-Top, You have been missing out.
The Original Pi-Top was a crowd funded project to turn a Raspberry Pi into a portable laptop computer, with an emphasis on educating young new software engineers. Complete with screen, mouse, and keyboard.

Now spend a bit of time on google, and you will see that the first version was pretty cool, but it certainly had its share of issues. From the awkward placement of the keyboard and trackpad, to the small hole on the side where you hoped you could fit a USb dongle.

The pi-topCEED, the desktop version, has several improvements over the original pitop. The modular rail became magnetic, rather than an area where you had to screw in parts.

Now pi-top is back with version 2 of their laptop. When I saw their new design, I decided it was good enough that i would check it out for myself. It arrived just a few weeks ago. Now after using it for a bit, I would like to give my thoughts so far.

# Customer Service

Initially when I pre-ordered my pi-top there was no date listed for when I could expect it to arrive.
